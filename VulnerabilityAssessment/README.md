## Introduction
These are some notes on a vulnerability scan that I did of a home lab I did. 
If you want more information on how I set up this lab please visit [DFIR](https://github.com/20austna/MyCyberProjects/tree/main/DFIR).

Note: none of the IPs will be excluded from screenshots because the machines have since been taken down due to the cost of maintaining them.

## Vulnerability Assessment 

Scan on my vultr server. Start by entering IP addresses for a host discovery scan:

I clicked submit, then checked all the boxes next to the IP addresses and hit run scan.
